# Food Supply Chain Sustainability

## synopsis 
Investigate the environmental and social impacts of different stages of the food supply chain, from production to distribution; of red meat from a cow and tofu from soybean. The metric will be the cost of the unit in each stage of the supply chain and its impact on the environment with respect to Downtown Houston in 2022. 
## data sources

Typical stages of food supply chain. Generating a database based on the following:
1. agriculture (raw material supplier) 
2. supplier (storing, raw material distributor)
3. production (packaging, processing from raw)
4. transport (LTL, distribution centers)
5. consumer (retail stores)
## smart goals
- **Specific:** meat vs tofu
- **Measurable:** as it relates to Downtown Houston
- **Achievable:** through the metric of unit price
- **Relevant:** define impact of cost to environmental justice 
- **Time-based:** 2-week sprint

## suggested processes
- simulate the impacts between beef and tofu through the food supply chain (database, ml, predictor)
- front end map with sliders to select different choices (js, leafletmap)
- accompanying visualization of impacts across the town (plotly or tableau)
