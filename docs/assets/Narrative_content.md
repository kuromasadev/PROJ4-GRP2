# Food Supply Chain Sustainability 



## Synopsis

Investigate the environmental and social impacts of different stages of the food supply chain, from production to distribution; of red meat from a cow and tofu from soybean. The metric will be the cost of the unit per pound in each stage of the supply chain and its impact on the social environment with respect to Downtown Houston in 2022. 

## Data Sources 

Typical stages of food supply chain condensed into five parts. Project team generated databases based on the following:
1. ***agriculture*** (raw material supplier) 
2. ***supplier*** (storing, raw material distributor)
3. ***production*** (packaging, processing from raw)
4. ***transport*** (LTL, distribution centers)
5. ***consumer*** (retail stores)

To maximize efficiency during the data collection phase, the following SMART goals were implemented: 

- **Specific:** meat (beef) vs tofu (soybean)
- **Measurable:** as it relates to Downtown Houston
- **Achievable:** through the metric of unit price ($ per lb)
- **Relevant:** define impact of cost to environmental justice (affordability of beef/soybeans)
- **Time-based:** 2022 or best available data
